##Health and Socially focused

The Primary goal of this project is to make a game that is unlike so many games before it. We want people to enjoy spending time in healthier ways than what normal games, that want you as a user to spend hours at end playing a game for nothing other than in-game rewards. We wanted to be different in that all of our activities revolve around doing things that are healthy for you as a human. We want to bring social interaction in the real world and healthy living a major priority in our project.
##The Plan:
1. Battle System
2. Geolocation for confirmation of some activities
3. Text or email reminders to take care of pet(yourself)
